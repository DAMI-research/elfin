    "text": "Advancements in new genetic indicators and novel microscopy methods have led to rapid development in the field of functional imaging of neurons. This includes techniques like calcium imaging, voltage imaging, and imaging of other neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin. To address the complexity and difficulty associated with processing such data, the Python package Elfin was developed. Elfin offers modularized designs for different tasks including motion correction, trace/image/video denoising, and signal extraction, etc. , all equipped with cutting-edge machine learning methods. Additionally, a user-friendly pipeline allows for seamless 1-click running of the entire analysis. Contributions from the community are warmly welcomed, fostering collaboration and continuous improvement of the package.\nWith Elfin, researchers can to fully harness the potential of functional imaging for addressing fundamental neuroscience questions."

In fact, every page of this documentation is also available as an interactive notebook - click “Open in colab” at the top of any page to open it (be sure to change the Colab runtime to “GPU” to have it run fast!) See the fast.ai documentation on Using Colab for more information.\nYou can install fastai on your own machines with conda (highly recommended), as long as you’re running Linux or Windows (NB: Mac is not supported). For Windows, please see the “Running on Windows” for important notes.\nWe recommend using miniconda (or miniforge). First install PyTorch using the conda line shown here, and then run:\nconda install -c fastai fastai\nTo install with pip, use: pip install fastai.\nIf you plan to develop fastai yourself, or want to be on the cutting edge, you can use an editable install (if you do this, you should also use an editable install of fastcore to go with it.) First install PyTorch, and then:\ngit clone https://github.com/fastai/fastai\npip install -e \"fastai[dev]\""

For each of the applications, the code is much the same.\nRead through the Tutorials to learn how to train your own models on your own datasets. Use the navigation sidebar to look through the fastai documentation. Every class, function, and method is documented here.\nTo learn about the design and motivation of the library, read the peer reviewed paper."

    "section": "About fastai",
    "text": "About fastai\nfastai is a deep learning library which provides practitioners with high-level components that can quickly and easily provide state-of-the-art results in standard deep learning domains, and provides researchers with low-level components that can be mixed and matched to build new approaches. It aims to do both things without substantial compromises in ease of use, flexibility, or performance. This is possible thanks to a carefully layered architecture, which expresses common underlying patterns of many deep learning and data processing techniques in terms of decoupled abstractions. These abstractions can be expressed concisely and clearly by leveraging the dynamism of the underlying Python language and the flexibility of the PyTorch library. fastai includes:\n\nA new type dispatch system for Python along with a semantic type hierarchy for tensors\nA GPU-optimized computer vision library which can be extended in pure Python\nAn optimizer which refactors out the common functionality of modern optimizers into two basic pieces, allowing optimization algorithms to be implemented in 4–5 lines of code\nA novel 2-way callback system that can access any part of the data, model, or optimizer and change it at any point during training\nA new data block API\nAnd much more…\n\nfastai is organized around two main design goals: to be approachable and rapidly productive, while also being deeply hackable and configurable. It is built on top of a hierarchy of lower-level APIs which provide composable building blocks. This way, a user wanting to rewrite part of the high-level API or add particular behavior to suit their needs does not have to learn how to use the lowest level."

Generally, you’ll be able to use all your existing data processing code, but will be able to reduce the amount of code you require for training, and more easily take advantage of modern best practices.

This makes tasks such as computer vision in Jupyter on Windows many times slower than on Linux. This limitation doesn’t exist if you use fastai from a script.\nSee this example to fully leverage the fastai API on Windows.\nWe recommend using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) instead – if you do that, you can use the regular Linux installation approach, and you won’t have any issues with num_workers."
