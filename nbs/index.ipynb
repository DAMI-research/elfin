    "Advancements in new genetic indicators and novel microscopy methods have led to rapid development in the field of functional imaging of neurons. This includes techniques like calcium imaging, voltage imaging, and imaging of other neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin. To address the complexity and difficulty associated with processing such data, the Python package ***Elfin*** was developed. ***Elfin*** offers modularized designs for different tasks including motion correction, trace/image/video denoising, and signal extraction, etc. , all equipped with cutting-edge machine learning methods. Additionally, a user-friendly pipeline allows for seamless 1-click running of the entire analysis. Contributions from the community are warmly welcomed, fostering collaboration and continuous improvement of the package.\n",

    "With ***Elfin***, researchers can to fully harness the potential of functional imaging for addressing fundamental neuroscience questions. \n",
